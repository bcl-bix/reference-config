# Reference management

Generate genome resources by downloading genome files and generating required files to facilitate running nf-core workflows.

## Description

This repository is to manage the reference genomes. The scripts here are used to:
- Download reference genomes from public repositories e.g. ENSEMBL, NCBI, etc
- Structure the reference files and link them to unique assembly names
- Provide an exaustive list of the hosted assemblies and their linked files to be used by bioinformatics workfllows such as nf-core
